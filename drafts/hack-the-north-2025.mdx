## Introduction

For those of you who don't know about Hack The North, it is the University of Waterloo's hackathon (surprise surprise) which is the largest in all of
Canada. Every year, more than a thousand people, from all across the world, come to this University for a weekend of building. I'll skip the stats
and stuff since you can read them on your own on the [site](https://hackthenorth.com/).

This year, Hack The North was hosted during the weekend of September 13th.

## Before

T'was the night before Hack The North. I was packing my bags and getting ready to meet up with some cool people and make a great project. With 
wayyyy too much excitement I got on the bus the next day at Carleton University. What was supposed to be a 6 hour drive quickly turned into a 9 hour
bus ride with 30 others from Ottawa, Montreal, and the UK (?!!)
